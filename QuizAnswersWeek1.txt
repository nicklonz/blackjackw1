1.  What is the value of a after the below code is executed?

      a = 1
      b = a
      b = 3

      ===> a=1

2.    What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?

An array is a sequence of indexed number or strings
A hash arrary where each character is paired as key and value ex. [:d => '4', :e => '5']

3.   Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:
  
        arr = [1, 2, 3, 3] ===>1,2,3,3
        [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq  ===>1,2,3 temporary
        [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq! ===>1,2,3 permanent

4.    What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.

The map method selects what is requested from the box
The select method selects values that meet a condtion in the box
  
5.    Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?

 h = {"d" => "dog", "c" => "cat"}

6.    What is returned?   "no way!"

      x = 1
      x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"
      
      ===> 4
     
7.   What is x?

    x = 1
      3.times do
        x += 1
      end
      puts x

     ===> X is 4 3 times in the loop plus 1 

8.    What is x?

    3.times do
        x += 1
      end
      puts x

    ===> is a non defined variable
